What I understand when I try to apply them for my problems is that: They are not easy to train / fine-tune They are difficult to explain They are difficult to deploy There are too many open source transformer models available right now and more and more are open sourced daily. So it's difficult to understand which is it the best one to use for the use case at hand. So in this article I will try to explain how to optimize the training / fine-tuning of transformers using different optimization techniques people use.

Competitions \u00b6 This is a list of competitions I have participated in: Feedback Prize - English Language Learning - link Riiid Answer Correctness Prediction - link Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction - link Feedback Prize - English Language Learning \u00b6 Competition Insights Competition Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better supports all students. Riiid Answer Correctness Prediction \u00b6 Competition Insights Competition Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/riiid-test-answer-prediction In this competition, we have to create algorithms for \"Knowledge Tracing,\" the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. We will pair our machine learning skills using Riiid\u2019s EdNet data. Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction \u00b6 Competition Insights Competition Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lish-moa In this competition, we have access to a unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. The data is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cells\u2019 responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). In addition, we will have access to MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in this dataset.","title":"Kaggle"},{"location":"kaggle/#kaggle","text":"Kaggle is a platform for users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.","title":"Kaggle"},{"location":"kaggle/#competitions","text":"This is a list of competitions I have participated in: Feedback Prize - English Language Learning - link Riiid Answer Correctness Prediction - link Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction - link","title":"Competitions"},{"location":"kaggle/#feedback-prize-english-language-learning","text":"Competition Insights Competition Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs).
